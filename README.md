# Raspberry Pi5 PWM Fan Control

The script was originally published by 
https://github.com/DriftKingTW

Due to the recent architectural changes (RPi.GPIO cannot operate on the GPIO), the original version of the script cannot work on the PI5.

I modified the script to make it suitable for the Raspberry PI 5.

The script can be used with ANY fan, using proper interfacing techniques.
Anyway, any 5V PWM NOCTUA fans have the advantage of being very quiet and having the PWM control cable directly connectable with GPIO pin of the PI.

# CONNECTIONS
YELLOW cable = +5V
BLACK cable = GND
GREEN CABLE = RPM sensing (needs a voltage divider, at least)
BLUE cable = PWM control (it is an open circuit with pull-up and i measured 2.6V on the cable, making it suitable for a direct connection to the GPIO header)

# TESTING

At the beginning of the script, you can find many useful parameter:

# Configuration

FAN_PIN # BCM pin used to drive PWM fan
WAIT_TIME # [s] Time to wait between each refresh
PWM_FREQ # [kHz] 25kHz for Noctua PWM control
MIN_TEMP # under this temp value fan is switched to the FAN_OFF speed
MAX_TEMP # over this temp value fan is switched to the FAN_MAX speed
FAN_LOW # lower side of the fan speed range during cooling
FAN_HIGH # higher side of the fan speed range during cooling
FAN_OFF # fan speed to set if the detected temp is below MIN_TEMP 
FAN_MAX # fan speed to set if the detected temp is above MAX_TEMP 

# Scripting

This is my first Python project and my first GitHub contribution.

I had to replace RPi.GPIO with gpiozero: gpiozero requires pwm values in the range between 0 and 1, where 0 stops the FAN and 1 speeds it up to 100% of the nominal speed.
That's why the speed generated by the original script is divided by 100.

      def setFanSpeed(speed):
      		pwm_fan.value = speed/100  # divide by 100 to get values from 0 to 1
      		return()

At the time of publishing, i only spent 2 hours on the project. 
Next i will focus on the RPM sensing script that is included but not modified.

Hope the solution will provide some relief to your hears in the meanwhile: it work really great.
Thanks to DriftKingTW for his contribution.

# As a Service

move fan_control.py to /usr/local/sbin/fan_control.py and use pifancontrol.service to start the script as a service.
